# Meme Jobs Classification Guide

This document defines what qualifies as a **meme job**, why we track them, and how to classify new examples for the dataset.

## Purpose

The goal of tracking *meme jobs* is to identify tech/CS job titles that:
- Use exaggerated or unclear language,
- Rely heavily on buzzwords,
- Or lack industry-standard definitions.

These roles often appear on LinkedIn profiles or personal branding pages rather than in formal job listings, making them useful indicators of hype-driven or non-standard titles in the tech ecosystem.

## What is a Meme Job?

A **meme job** is a job title that sounds impressive or futuristic, but:
- Does not clearly explain the actual responsibilities,
- Uses unnecessary buzzwords,
- Or includes self-aggrandizing/heroic language.

Examples include:  
*“AI/ML Ninja”, “Blockchain Evangelist”, “Growth Hacker”, “Digital Alchemist”, “Metaverse Architect”.*

---

## Classification Rules

A job title is classified as a **meme job** if it meets **at least 2** of the following rules:

### 1. Excessive Buzzwords
Contains 3+ hype terms such as:
- AI, ML, Blockchain, Web3, Metaverse  
- Disrupt, Innovate, Digital Transformation  
- Visionary, Evangelist, Catalyst

### 2. Vague or Undefined Role
Does not map to a recognized, standard industry position.  
Examples:  
- “Digital Experience Curator”  
- “Innovation Sherpa”  
- “Paradigm Shift Engineer”

### 3. Rarely Used in Real Job Postings
Common on personal branding profiles, but not found in:
- Corporate job boards  
- Standard HR categories  
- Industry hiring pipelines

### 4. Self-Aggrandizing Language
Includes heroic or exaggerated self-titles:
- Ninja  
- Rockstar  
- Guru  
- Unicorn  
- Wizard  
- Sorcerer  

### 5. Overly Broad or Catch-All
Describes everything and nothing at the same time.  
Example:  
- “Tech Thought Leader”  
- “Future of Work Strategist”

## Exceptions

### Satire or Clear Jokes
Titles that are obviously comedic or intentionally humorous are excluded unless they appear frequently across LinkedIn.
Examples:
- “Chief Meme Officer”
- “Head of Vibes”
- “Chief Happiness Wizard”

### Niche/Industry-Specific Titles
Some titles may look meme-like but are legitimate in certain industries.  
These should be evaluated on context before classification.

---

## Edge Cases

Some titles may sit between real and meme depending on the timeline or industry trends.  
Examples:
- “Prompt Engineer” (legitimate today, but vague during early LLM hype)
- “AI Consultant” (real role but often used vaguely)
- “Digital Transformation Specialist” (sometimes real, sometimes extremely vague)

Document context when adding such titles.

## Maintenance and Contribution

This list will evolve over time.  
Contributors should:

1. Justify why a new title qualifies as a meme job.
2. Apply the classification rules consistently.
3. Add examples only if they meet **two or more** rules.
4. Note edge cases when unsure.

Regular updates ensure the dataset reflects the current tech landscape and ongoing trends.
